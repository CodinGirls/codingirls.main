CodinGirls aims to open up technology and make it more approachable for girls and women.

The weekend event is free and open to all enthusiastic girls and women. 
Python for Girls wants to empower girls to build the capacity and acquire the tools to conquer the last online frontier. We are a fully non-profit operation - the events are organized together with local sponsors. The Finnish operations have a small base funding from Ministry of Transport and Communication. Rails Girls Summer of Code is made possible with the effort from Travis Foundation.
